It's React Interview trick questions Time ⏰!

## Motivation

The goal here is to have fun by learning more about React and it's rendering paradigm while also having a sandbox you could mess around will multiple `App` configurations.

**Hint:** Try your best to guess the result without running the dev server! (then cross check with the actual result and figure out why where you correct / wrong)

Enjoy! 🎉🎉🎉

## Introduction

This repo is all about learning React in a better way and the nitty gritty stuff about:

- `console.log` events 📋 during component lifecycle
- `useEffect, useMemo, useCallback` executions ⚛
- `will it re-render?` scenarios 🌀
- `Context` API 🚀

## Lesson setup

Simply choose the lesson you want to learn under the `lesson` dir and take that corresponding component into `App.tsx`. Then figure out what will be `console.loged` / triggered in `useEffect` / `will be re-rendered`.

## How do I run this?

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Run dev server

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Testing

Unit testing

```
yarn test
```
